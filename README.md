 MERN Stack Project: Build and Deploy a Real Time Chat App | JWT, Socket.io

Introduction
The Real-Time Chat Application is a full-stack web project built using the MERN Stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js — along with Socket.io for real-time communication and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication. This application allows users to register, log in, and exchange messages instantly with others in real time. Designed for scalability and responsiveness, the project demonstrates modern web development practices, integrating secure backend APIs, real-time WebSocket connections, and a dynamic, user-friendly frontend.

Some Features:

-   Tech stack: MERN + Socket.io + TailwindCSS + Daisy UI
-   Authentication && Authorization with JWT
-   Real-time messaging with Socket.io
-   Online user status (Socket.io and React Context)
-   Global state management with Zustand
-   Error handling both on the server and on the client
